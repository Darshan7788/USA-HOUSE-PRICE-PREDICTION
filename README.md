# USA House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting house prices in the USA using machine learning techniques. The aim is to build a model that can accurately predict the price of a house based on various features such as the size, location, number of bedrooms, and more.

The dataset used for this project includes various housing features, and different machine learning models are applied to determine the best performing model in terms of prediction accuracy.

## Project Structure

- `USA_house_prediction.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the entire workflow, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
- `data/`: Directory where the dataset used for the project is stored (this folder is not included, but you should place your dataset here).
- `models/`: Directory where trained models are saved (optional).
- `results/`: Directory where results, such as graphs and model performance metrics, are stored (optional).
- `README.md`: Project description and instructions.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes various features related to house prices. The features may include:

- **Size**: Square footage of the house.
- **Location**: Geographical location (state, city, etc.).
- **Number of bedrooms and bathrooms**.
- **Year built**.
- **Other relevant features**.

If you use a specific dataset, such as one from Kaggle or any other source, please mention the source and provide a link to it.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the code in this repository, you need the following libraries:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install the required packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

### Running the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd yourrepository
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook USA_house_prediction.ipynb
   ```
4. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Model Performance

In this project, various machine learning models are explored, including:

- **Linear Regression**
- **Random Forest**
- **Gradient Boosting Machines**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **Neural Networks**

The models are evaluated based on performance metrics such as:

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **R-squared (RÂ²)**

The best-performing model is selected based on these metrics.

## Results

The results of the model, including prediction accuracy and error metrics, are displayed in the notebook. Visualizations such as feature importance and predicted vs. actual prices are also included.

## Conclusion

The project successfully predicts house prices with a certain level of accuracy. The selected model can be used to estimate the price of a house based on its features. Further improvements can be made by tuning the models, using more advanced algorithms, or incorporating additional data.
